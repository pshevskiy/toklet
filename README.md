# Toklet
Toklet — Fast, lightweight LLM inference on Apple Silicon. An open-source Rust inference engine focused on low latency, efficient memory usage, and simple, understandable code.

See the [implementation plan](PLAN.md) for milestones, dependencies, and acceptance criteria, and the [Apple LLM performance proposal](apple_llm_performance_plan.md) for the design rationale.

The initial package contains a library and CLI shell. Model loading and generation are planned; the shell currently provides help and version information.

Use Rust 1.90 or newer. The package has no external dependencies and builds without model downloads or Apple frameworks:

```sh
cargo build --locked --offline
cargo run --locked --offline -- --help
cargo run --locked --offline -- --version
```

Run the checks locally:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --offline --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --offline
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the same checks and a release build on Linux with Rust 1.90.0. Store downloaded models and conversion output in `models/` or `artifacts/`, and large raw benchmark output in `benchmarks/raw/`; these directories are ignored. Small fixtures, manifests, scripts, and compact reports remain versioned.
