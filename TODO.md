# Toklet progress checklist

Updated **7 November 2026**. **Active Mac scope complete; iPhone deferred by user.**
Read this file first, then the relevant plan criteria and targeted code/diff.
Completed history is in the [dated archive](docs/archive/2026-11-07/README.md).

## Current and next task

- [x] Research and write the [observability/performance proposal](docs/observability-performance-proposal.md).
  Current code, retained experiments and primary ClickHouse sources inspected;
  documentation checks pass. Commit `338c4e5b`;
  [checks](artifacts/observability-performance-proposal-2026-11-07/checks.txt).
- [x] Archive previous working-document history and replace live records with
  compact current indexes; preserve all evidence and binding acceptance policy.
- [x] Pass archive integrity, link/anchor, content-preservation and whitespace
  checks; [validation record](artifacts/context-archive-2026-11-07/checks.json).

Current task: completed the [model/observability plan](docs/model-observability-plan.md)
with observability first, Gemma 4 E2B → Qwen3.5-4B → Qwen3.5-9B, preferred
uncensored MLX artifacts and five verified under-4B candidates.
- [x] Research exact parameter counts, artifact lineage and MLX format/gaps.
- [x] Specify timing/throughput/memory/state/outcome/overhead metrics and gates.
- [x] Pass documentation content/link/whitespace checks; commit/evidence in the
  [validation record](artifacts/model-observability-plan-2026-11-07/checks.json).
Next implementation task: O1 metrics on the existing Gemma BF16 Mac route,
then O2 baseline before performance changes. This plan update does not resume
the implementation stopped on 7 November before integration/checks/review.
The unfinished summary types in `apple/Harness/NativeRequestSummary.swift` and
source-list addition remain uncommitted and unqualified. Qwen2.5-1.5B is now a
historical reference, superseded in the forward queue by Qwen3.5-4B and 9B.
- [ ] Implement bounded summaries and export with authoritative terminal state.
- [ ] Run portable, Swift, real Mac and overhead checks; retain full logs.
- [ ] Obtain combined Astra review, update evidence and commit.
O1 is stopped at the user's request. No O1 checks or Astra approval are claimed.

## Working method

- Update current/next work, checkboxes, blockers and check/review outcomes after
  every iteration, including research, failed checks and interrupted work.
- Keep entries concise; link full logs in artifacts and evidence/commit records.
- Code completion requires applicable checks and one combined Astra review of
  diff, invariants and results before commit. Keep [improvements](docs/improvements.md)
  current. Documentation-only work needs link/content and whitespace checks.
- Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for binding criteria, the
  [design rationale](apple_llm_performance_plan.md) when relevant, and targeted
  source before assuming a feature exists. Read archives only on demand.
- Preserve historical failures and scope limits. Mac observations do not qualify
  iPhone; planning/admission estimates do not establish allocation or execution.

## Current delivery and retained decisions

| Area | Current scope and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Foundation M0–M7 | Complete in recorded scopes; [plan](PLAN.md), [M7 closure](docs/experiments/2026-10-21-m7-release.md). Later iPhone work remains deferred. |
| M8 shared blocks, model breadth and capacity controls | Selected Mac engine/app scopes delivered; [coverage index](docs/model-coverage.md), [shared-block contract](docs/shared-block-model-plan.md), [historical checklist](docs/archive/2026-11-07/TODO.md#m8--architecture-breadth-and-usable-context-controls). No blanket family/full-window qualification. |
| Managed Mac journeys | Six earlier profile journeys reviewed; [report](docs/mac-hub-journeys.md). Qwen1.5B Chat/native41 complete; [evidence](benchmarks/results/2026-11-06-qwen15-mac-app-v1.json). |
| Official Gemma BF16 Mac | Full 10.28 GB public snapshot, six-file SHA, managed publication, Chat/Stop and network-denied reopen pass; [journey](benchmarks/results/2026-11-07-gemma-public-resume-mac-v1.json). Native45 Settings/context/KV checks pass; [evidence](benchmarks/results/2026-11-06-gemma-bf16-live-window-v1.json). |
| G2 prefill | Retained on official BF16 Mac route; both primary runs reduce prefill about 61% and request time about 28%; [evidence](benchmarks/results/2026-11-06-gemma-bf16-g2-retention-v1.json). |
| M9 affine tile | First delivery complete as pinned Mac opt-in, with full quality, state and repeated timing. Managed adoption remains separate; [decision](docs/m9-mac-affine-decision.md). |
| Memory reporting | Owner snapshots, physical KV ceiling in Preview/Apply and conditional load-process peaks complete; [owner](benchmarks/results/2026-11-02-session-owner-memory-v1.json), [KV](benchmarks/results/2026-11-03-kv-preview-apply-v1.json), [loading](benchmarks/results/2026-11-03-load-memory-checkpoints-v1.json). Planned/admitted, owned and measured memory remain distinct. |

## Open or deferred scope

- [ ] Record separate iPhone Settings runtime evidence.
- [ ] Independent physical iPhone14Pro journeys/Settings; latest connection query times out.

The user deferred this device work on 5 November. The paired iPhone 14 Pro is
unavailable; a different Pro Max is not a substitute.
[Availability evidence](artifacts/m8-phone-availability-2026-11-04/availability.json).

Full-Qwen3-window expansion and unselected research techniques remain deferred.
The [detailed plans](docs/todo-implementation-plans.md) preserve task-specific
acceptance; older queue statements and historical pending notes do not override
later accepted decisions. Use the [archived M8 closure record](docs/archive/2026-11-07/TODO.md#m8-closure)
for individual model/adoption limitations.

Preserve these rejected or restricted results:

- Gemma3 coupled-intermediate rejections remain failed under the recorded
  [conformance policy](docs/gemma3-native-conformance.md); full adoption is distinct.
- Qwen3 historical fidelity rejections remain separate from scoped native
  qualification; [native profile](docs/qwen3-native-profile.md).
- Llama Online and split-KV candidates remain rejected/deferred under unchanged
  gates; [Llama decision](docs/todo-implementation-plans.md#llama-online-correctness),
  [split-KV evidence](benchmarks/results/2026-11-05-m9-split-kv-session-v1.json).
- Gemma QAT full task quality fails the two-point loss limit; passing loss/wrap
  fidelity does not override it; [evidence](benchmarks/results/2026-11-06-gemma-qat-full-quality-v1.json).
- G3 assistant remains test-only after the longer guard regressed about 21%;
  [decision](benchmarks/results/2026-11-06-gemma-assistant-mtp-retention-v1.json).
- Prompt lookup remains an explicit nonstreaming API; default adoption rejected.
  [Plan and evidence](docs/todo-implementation-plans.md#p5-strict-greedy-verifier-and-prompt-lookup).

## Latest iteration

| Date | Result and checks | Evidence / next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-11-07 | Observability-first plan complete; five exact under-4B counts verified. Preferred uncensored MLX formats/lineage and conversion/memory gaps recorded. Initial metadata DNS/Python certificate failures resolved with system curl; receipts retained. Documentation checks pass; binding policy unchanged. No runtime checks/Astra review claimed. | [Plan](docs/model-observability-plan.md), [checks/commit](artifacts/model-observability-plan-2026-11-07/checks.json); next implementation O1 remains stopped. |
| 2026-11-07 | Researched ten current under-30B candidates from primary sources; capability/local-efficiency shortlist, not common-harness qualification. O1 stopped; unfinished code uncommitted and unchecked. Documentation checks pass. | [Research](docs/models-under-30b-2026-11-07.md), [checks](artifacts/models-under-30b-2026-11-07/checks.json); model selection next. |
| 2026-11-07 | Archived full TODO/PLAN/improvement snapshots at `338c4e5b`; routine document bytes reduced about 97%. All snapshot text, 32 milestone criteria, four binding policy sections and both open items preserved; link/content/whitespace checks pass. Documentation-only. | [Archive manifest](docs/archive/2026-11-07/manifest.json), [checks](artifacts/context-archive-2026-11-07/checks.json); next proposed O1 pilot. |

Older iterations and all completed checklists remain in the
[archived TODO](docs/archive/2026-11-07/TODO.md). Add only a concise recent record
here; archive completed history periodically rather than loading it by default.
